# chatbot-client

this is the frontend / client side of my chatbot app
1. written in React JS and Google Material Design (MUI)
2. client-side caching by React-query, reducing the number of requests that need to be sent to the server.
3. CI/CD pipeline powered by AWS EC2 / Linux Ubuntu

to run it local: `npm start`
